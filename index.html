  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

  <!-- below is an ordered list with 4 list items. Item 3 contains 2 classes (list1 & list2) inside 2 span tags respectively.
Where as Item 4 has a class within itself. -->

  <ol type="1">
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
    <li>CSS describes how html elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in other media.</li>
    <li><span class="list1">Css is not necessary</span> <span class="list2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can
      control
      the layout of multiple webpages all at once</li>
    <li class="list3">External style sheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
  </ol>

  <!-- below is an h2 tag followed by an unordered list with 4 list items.
Item 4 contains a class (list4) inside a span tag. -->

  <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CCS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="list4">in
        this
        tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for
      you to try it yourself.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- below are 3 paragraph tags followed by an anchor tag.
The anchor tag contains a class (anchor1). -->

  <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.
    ID, on the othe hand, applies a style to one unique element.
    ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
  <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.
    Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
  <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.
    Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
